                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Shweta Bhatia. I was born in Delhi, India on 5th April 1987. I am a postgraduate in business administration. I have been living in Hong Kong for more than 6 years now.<br><br>
                    I am a very experimental kind of person who likes to go out of her comfort zone and try new things.<br><br>
                    I am a big foodie. My favorite comfort food is noodles (any kind).<br><br>
                    Also, not just eating, I love to cook as well. I am a decent cook.<br><br>
                </p>
